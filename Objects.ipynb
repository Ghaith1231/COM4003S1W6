    "### Why Use Objects?\n",
    "Objects are a crucial part of JavaScript because they allow you to structure your data in a more meaningful way. Instead of having separate variables for each property of a car, you can group them together in an object. This makes your code more organized, reusable, and easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects also play a central role in object-oriented programming (OOP), a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. JavaScript's support for objects makes it a versatile language that can be used for procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming."

    "Replicate the examples and avoid copy/pasting the code. Understand each line of code and write it yourself. Practice makes perfect. "
