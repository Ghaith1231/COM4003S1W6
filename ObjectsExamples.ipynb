    "`this` is a keyword in JavaScript that refers to the object on which the current function is being invoked. \n",
    "\n",
    "`this` is particularly useful because it ensures that you are accessing the properties of the object on which the method was called, even if there are other objects or variables with similar properties in the scope. It helps to keep your code modular and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a method (a function inside an object), `this` allows you to access properties and other methods of the same object.\n",

    "```javascript\n",
    "let book = {\n",
    "  title: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\",\n",
    "  author: \"J.K. Rowling\",\n",
    "  year: 1997,\n",
    "  getSummary: function() {\n",
    "    return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author} in ${this.year}.`;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",

    "In this object `book`, there are three properties: `title`, `author`, and `year`, and one method: `getSummary`.\n",

    "- `this.title` refers to the `title` property of the `book` object.\n",
    "- `this.author` refers to the `author` property of the `book` object.\n",
    "- `this.year` refers to the `year` property of the `book` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you call `book.getSummary()`, it returns the string \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was written by J.K. Rowling in 1997.\"."
